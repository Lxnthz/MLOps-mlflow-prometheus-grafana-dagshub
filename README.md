# MLOps with MLflow, Prometheus, Grafana, and DagsHub

## About This Repository

This repository is a hands-on project where I get the opportunity to learn and explore the world of MLOps while contributing to a friend's project. It serves as a practical implementation of MLOps concepts, integrating tools like MLflow, Prometheus, Grafana, and DagsHub to create a robust machine learning workflow.

## What I Do Here

In this repository, I focus on:

1. **Experiment Tracking with MLflow**:

   - Setting up MLflow to track machine learning experiments.
   - Logging metrics, parameters, and models for reproducibility.
   - Managing model versions and artifacts.

2. **Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana**:

   - Configuring Prometheus to collect metrics from the machine learning pipeline.
   - Visualizing metrics and system performance using Grafana dashboards.

3. **Collaboration with DagsHub**:

   - Using DagsHub for version control and data management.
   - Collaborating on machine learning experiments and sharing results.

4. **Workflow Automation**:

   - Writing CI/CD workflows to automate the training, testing, and deployment of machine learning models.
   - Ensuring the pipeline is efficient and scalable.

5. **Debugging and Enhancements**:
   - Debugging issues in the pipeline and improving the workflow.
   - Ensuring compatibility with the latest versions of tools and frameworks.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- **MLflow**: For experiment tracking and model management.
- **Prometheus**: For monitoring metrics.
- **Grafana**: For creating insightful dashboards.
- **DagsHub**: For collaborative machine learning workflows.
- **GitHub Actions**: For CI/CD automation.
- **Python**: For scripting and machine learning tasks.
- **Docker**: For model building and storage location

## Why This Project Matters
